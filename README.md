# CodeTrainer-v2-Assembly-Rewritten

Hello, thank you for using CodeTrainer version 2's other remastered versions/remakes. This application is for those who want a slighlty different test with having A, B, or C as answers and the application being bigger. This application was made for a challenge reason. Below, i have answered some questions as i did with Lost Woods too. (If you haven't checked Lost Woods out yet, please do!)

1. This project does not solve any problems, but this project is for those who want a slighlty different quiz than the other CodeTrainer versions and a bigger one being around 1150 lines of code.

2. I chose Windows to pursue this application because i only know the Windows version of Assembly and thought it could be fun.

3. I also considered making it multiplatformed, but considering my time and pace i rejected it because i only had 3 hours to make this. I finished the entire project in 2 hours.

4. The project wouldn't break if a 1000 or more users suddenly started using it because it is a application that's local. However, for now only Windows as a operating system is accepted for this application.

5. I wouldn't change anything to handle 1000 users because it automatically can but it still depends on your laptop. I doubt it wouldn't run a Windows laptop, all it needs is a CPU and a screen honestly.

6. This time, i chose pace over simplicity. If i ever shared the code with developers, they would find it interesting and a little bit complex because of how weirdly functions are placed.


All for now, i am willing to share more projects into my GitHub in the future and maybe better applications using UI's. But for now, thank you for using CodeTrainer and my applications, have fun.
