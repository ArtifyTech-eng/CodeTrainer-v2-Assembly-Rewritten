# CodeTrainer Contributing Guide

Hi, thanks for being interested in contributing CodeTrainer. Let me explain how you can contribute and the rules.

# How to Contribute

You can help make CodeTrainer a better educational app by giving:

New questions, coding examples, or literal codes.

We would appreciate new questions and use them on newer versions like CodeTrainer v2.72 which is expected to release being a incredibly big and modular new educational coding application supporting many languages too.
Also, don't worry about credits! We appreciate any help and surely give credit for it. If any monetization occurs, you get your share. 

# Rules

There aren't much rules, but some important ones are: You can't give questions from older versions of CodeTrainer as "new" questions, or you can't directly ask for credit. We will give credit.
